<h1> this is about Daly Willet she gave me consent to write a report about her</h1>
<p> daly likes halloween more than dia de los muertos. She likes it because candy is good and trick or treating is fun. Dia de los Muertos freaks her out because the catrina barbie doll is haunting her. She is so scared of the doll that she ran to Hawaii where mrs g attacked her becuse she said it was a US state. Then she went to florida where she met Trump and voted him for 2020 election. Then she moved to NY where the barbie doll ate her house. She met Ariana Grande and sang christmas songs with her. Then Ariana Grande made an announcement. "the catrina doll will be made in everstate of america! everyone gets a free one today!" Daly flew on a pigeon to africa where she met an elephant. The elephants name was fred and they became friends. Then the elephant ran away to marry the catrina doll. They became happy and the elephant convinced catrina not to haunt Daly. They all lived happily ever after!!!!!!!</p>
